I have received multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with four options and the correct answer. Please convert the following data into the format shown below for each question.

For each question:

Extract the question text.
Extract the four options.
Extract the correct answer and assign it to the "answer" field.

Output the result in the following format:

question_data = {
    "question": "The question text",
    "options": ["option1", "option2", "option3", "option4"],
    "answer": "correct_answer"
}

Here is the MCQ data you need to process (with each question having the four options and the correct answer):

Input Data:

question_data = [
    {
        "question": "What is the capital of France?",
        "options": ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
        "answer": "Paris"
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of these is a programming language?",
        "options": ["English", "Python", "Table", "Mountain"],
